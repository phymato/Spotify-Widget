# Spotify-Widget
A neat little popup-window that you can capture and add to your streams.

Unfortunately, because of the way Spotify works, users need to be manually approved on your spotify app in the developer dashboard before API requests will start working.

If you want to use this, I suggest making your own app on the Spotify dashboard and modifying the client id + callback uri.
